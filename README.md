# Xovich
"This is a fun little program I made to test my knowledge of programming," said Kabilan Thesingarajah.
"I don't care about doing this in one line, I just want this as a GUI," said me when I found this repo.

## Scenario (originally by Kabilan):

My best friend was cold-texted by a random number. This person was presumably a Chinese Lady, but with doubt, so we wanted to proxy our identity. We wanted to be Russian. 
I then advised changing his name slightly. Whereby his surname is his first name, with "ovich" concatenated to it. 
This was a simple task, so to test our patience, and our python programming skills, we endeavoured to do this in one line.

Here is the final program we made in one afternoon at a Starbucks.

I don't know what you will do with this, but I really enjoyed making it, so here is my gift to the interwebs.

## TODO:
- Create the GUI
- Implement the functionality in tkinter without doing this in one line.
- Rename master branch to main.
