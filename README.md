# Xovich

"This is a fun little program I made to test my knowledge of programming," said Kabilan Thesingarajah.
"I don't care about doing this in one line, I just want this as a GUI," said me when I found this repo.

## Scenario (originally by Kabilan, added to by me)

Kabilan's best friend was cold-texted by a random number. This person was presumably a Chinese Lady, but with doubt, so they wanted to proxy their identity. They wanted to be Russian.
He then advised his best friend to change his name _very_ slightly. Whereby his surname is his first name, with "ovich" concatenated to it.
This was a simple task, so to test their patience, and their Python programming skills, they initially endeavoured to do this in one line. They eventually managed to do it in one afternoon at a Starbucks, and, without knowing what anyone would do with it, released it as a gift to the so-called "interwebs".

Three months later, his _other_ best friend (aka me) came across his one-line program, and I need to complete this paragraph later.

## TODO

- ~~Create the GUI~~
- ~~Implement the actual processing power into the button, checkbox and entry fields.~~
- ~~Implement the functionality in tkinter without doing this in one line.~~
- ~~Rename master branch to main (**EDIT: already done, removed master branch**).~~
- Devise some unit tests on my program and try to get them to enter text into the fields and create names by themselves.
